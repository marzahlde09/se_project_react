# Project 3: WTWR with React

WTWR web page that displays a gallery of garments depending on the weather. The garments are assigned a type of weather (currently hot, warm, and cold) and are only added to the DOM if they match the weather fetched from Open Weather Map. A banner appears below the header displaying the current temperature and an image depending on the type of weather outside (clear, cloudy, rainy, stormy, snowy, foggy). The project is built using React and JSX.

## Plan on improving the project

- Different users should have their own authentication and page so as to store their own garments and refer to the weather locally
- Users should be able to "like" garments, possibly including them earlier in the list as frequently viewed cards
